# DoorKickersWeaponCompare

This is a Q&D tool to export and compare weapon stats from the game [Door Kickers](http://inthekillhouse.com/doorkickers/). Not beautiful, but it does the job. It reads the original game data files (_SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/DoorKickers/data/object_library/\*equipment\*.xml_) and parses them for firearm stats.

A similar set of data was shown by _Glurk_ as a Steam Community Guide: [All weapons stats](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=633474891) but sadly he only shared it as an image.

## Gimme data
The _raw_ TSV (tab separated values) can be found here: [info.tsv](data/info.tsv), if you don't want to mess with importing here is a google spreadsheet you can copy: [Door Kickers Weapon Stats](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IUor4TyqxRYdVIGY1SOJOHm17Oa9Ra8YIc-gokiqljM/edit?usp=sharing)

## Note
Last time I checked (May 2024) the stats were still the same.
